Release Notes 1.0.1 : 10-11-2014 

About:

This environment package is ideal for your desert missions and adventures on desktop or mobile platforms. It is highly configurable and the assets looks perfect from close up making it ideal for first person games. The Unity terrain blends seamless into a low poly surrounding mesh, which in turn blends seamless into a rendered skybox to create the feeling of an endless landscape of mountainous dunes. With ancient Baobab tree's, realistic sandstone rocks, desert cacti, ruins, wind pumps and the Kalahari indigenous Acacia tree's; this terrain will immerse your player in an arid landscape with no equal.

Rocks:
A set of 9 sandstone rocks. They have a sandstone feel to them and work well on sandy parts of your scene. They are provided colourless so that you can adapt them perfectly to the tone of your scene.

The textures are in layered PSD's so that you may remove/add/colour the 4 different Rock layers individually. All the rocks are low poly and mobile ready with 2048x2048 textures. A custom shader tiles a sandy normal map to ensure zero texture distortion even from very close, making these rocks ideal for FPS use.
